## Generating figures

The R scripts under `R_code` will regenerate the figures used in the manuscript. It has been tested with R 3.5.2 on OS X. The scripts use a number of packages, some of which you may need to install via `install.packages`. All the figures can be regenerated by running
```
R CMD BATCH make_all_figures.R
```
The final figures will be located under `R_code/figs`
