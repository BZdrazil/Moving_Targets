The work attempts to characterize trends in attention for targets and diseases based on publication of bioactivity data in ChEMBL. The disease trends are imputed from the targets associated with the disease.

### Availability

The application is based on ChEMBL 25 and the source code and datasets for the application is available at [https://github.com/BZdrazil/Moving_Targets/App](https://github.com/BZdrazil/Moving_Targets/App)
